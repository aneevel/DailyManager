# DailyManager
Modern web application which allows users to customize views of tracking daily habits and tasks

Why?

   - I am interested in a habit/task software solution that works for me, and hopefully others.
   - Most software solutions I encounter tackle one of these things at a time, but not the other. Yet I want a solution that centralizes all tracking and allows me to manage them from the same spot.
  - I want to gain more experience developing React apps.

What?

  - A modern web app (possibly eventually mobile) that allows an user customizable ways of viewing and tracking daily/persistent habits, as well as one off or recurring tasks. 
 - User can create categories of tasks vs hobbies in any way they want, and select tracking methods, as well as states of recurrence, methods of completion, instructions for the task
 - The app will keep track of how consistently you perform habits, and eventually provide insight into how and when you are most successful
 - App encourages you to break tasks down into manageable chunks and reinforces dopamine release via visual/audio stimulus and congratulatory text
 - "Traits" implementation which are customizable "tracks" which combines habits and tasks and allow an user to define personality traits they wish to develop or maintain, which correlate to habits/tasks being performed

How?

 - App will use PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)
 - Design the UI
 - Implement UI using React and dummy data at first
 - Design the database
 - Build the database with PostgreSQL
 - Design the backend
 - Build the backend with Express
 - Utilize Netlify for deployment (or look into alternative if this does not work)
